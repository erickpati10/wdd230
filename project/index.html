          Location: Santa Monica is situated on the southern coast of
          California, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is
          approximately 16 miles (26 kilometers) west of downtown Los Angeles.
          <br />
          Climate: Santa Monica enjoys a Mediterranean climate characterized by
          mild, pleasant winters and warm, dry summers. Average temperatures
          range from around 55째F (13째C) in winter to 75째F (24째C) in summer. The
          area typically experiences coastal fog, known as the "June Gloom,"
          during the early summer mornings. Cultural Attractions: The city
          boasts cultural attractions such as the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium,
          which provides an educational experience about marine life. The
          Annenberg Community Beach House offers public facilities, including a
          pool, gallery space, and community events. The Getty Villa, a museum
          dedicated to ancient art, is located just outside Santa Monica in the
          Pacific Palisades.
